# Changelog

All notable changes to jol-control will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added
- `solo_mode` variable for single-owner operation — drops multi-reviewer and code-owner gates while keeping signed commits, linear history, and force-push/deletion blocks
- Dynamic branch protection blocks that adapt to solo_mode vs team operation
- RA-03 risk acceptance entry for local Terraform state (no remote backend)

### Changed
- Migrated `vulnerability_alerts` from deprecated inline argument to separate `github_repository_vulnerability_alerts` resource (provider v6.x compatibility)
- Updated `required_approving_review_count` validation to allow 0 (solo mode)
- Removed unused `data.github_organization.jol` and `data.github_team.security` data sources
- Removed security manager role resources from org-settings.tf (no teams in solo mode)

### Fixed
- Documentation accuracy: replaced false S3/DynamoDB state claims with local state reality in `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/threat-model.md`
- CI workflows: removed non-functional AWS credential references from `plan.yml` and `apply.yml` (local state requires no AWS credentials)
- Removed unnecessary `requests` dependency from `compliance-scan.yml` drift detection step
- Added `.jolarca-staging/` to `.gitignore` to prevent foreign project artifacts

### Removed
- PyCharm utility scripts (disable_pycharm_plugins.sh, disable_pycharm_power_save.sh) — not control-plane infrastructure

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added
- Initial release — central governance control plane for journeyoflife-org
- 40 repository YAML allow-list definitions (repos/*.yml)
- Policy baselines: repo-defaults.yml, compliance-gates.yml
- Terraform IaC: GitHub provider, repository resources, branch protection
- CI/CD workflows: plan (PR comment), apply (dev→staging→prod), compliance-scan
- Audit checklists: SOC 2, GDPR, ISO 27001
- Python scripts: validate_repos, compliance_check, drift_detect
- Documentation: architecture, runbooks, threat model, data classification, change management
- Compliance frameworks: SOC 2 Type II, GDPR, ISO 27001:2022, PCI-DSS 4.0
